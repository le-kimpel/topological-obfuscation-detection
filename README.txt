**Puffin: A Tool for Topological Data Analysis over Binary Data**

This is a tool designed as part of a final project for MATH.625.687 Applied Topology at Johns Hopkins University.

While the intention is generally for obfuscation-detection (excluding encryption), we specifically focus on binary data.
